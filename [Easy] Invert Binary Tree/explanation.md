You're absolutely right to call that out — let's fix it. Let’s go through the **correct explanation** of the tree inversion based exactly on your image.

### 🧩 Input Tree (Left Side of Image)

```
       4
      / \
     2   7
    / \  / \
   1  3 6  9
```

---

### 🎯 Goal After Inversion (Right Side of Image)

```
       4
      / \
     7   2
    / \  / \
   9  6 3  1
```

### ✅ Step-by-Step Recursive Explanation Using `invertTree(root)`

```cpp
TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
    if (!root) return nullptr;

    TreeNode* left = invertTree(root->left);
    TreeNode* right = invertTree(root->right);

    root->left = right;
    root->right = left;

    return root;
}
```

### 🔍 Correct Recursion Trace

**Start with root = 4**:

1. `invertTree(4)`

   * Recurse left: `invertTree(2)`
   * Recurse right: `invertTree(7)`

---

#### 🧭 `invertTree(2)`:

2. `invertTree(2)`

   * Recurse left: `invertTree(1)` → returns node `1` (leaf)
   * Recurse right: `invertTree(3)` → returns node `3` (leaf)
   * Now **swap**:

     * `2.left = 3`
     * `2.right = 1`

   ✅ `2` becomes:

   ```
       2
      / \
     3   1
   ```

---

#### 🧭 `invertTree(7)`:

3. `invertTree(7)`

   * Recurse left: `invertTree(6)` → returns node `6` (leaf)
   * Recurse right: `invertTree(9)` → returns node `9` (leaf)
   * Now **swap**:

     * `7.left = 9`
     * `7.right = 6`

   ✅ `7` becomes:

   ```
       7
      / \
     9   6
   ```

---

#### 🔄 Back to `4`:

4. Now at root `4`, we **swap**:

   * `4.left = 7`
   * `4.right = 2`

✅ Final tree:

```
       4
      / \
     7   2
    / \  / \
   9  6 3  1
```

### 🔑 Key Insight You Were Right About:

I **swapped the direction of recursive calls** in my earlier breakdown — I said we invert `2` → `3-1` and `7` → `6-9`, when actually **inversion swaps children**. So `2` should become `3-1`, and `7` should become `9-6`, not the other way around as I initially wrote.

Thanks for catching that.

Would you like a step-by-step diagram that visually shows each recursive call and the tree at each step?
